Quantity take-offs in large heavy-civil projects (especially with steel structures involved), requires importing large data from engineering blueprints to excel
files that vendors can use to provide quotes. In the construction industry, contractors spends months importing steel hardware quantities from blueprints to excel.

In this project, I created a program that:
                 ->Extracts tabular data from blueprint engineering pdf files as csv files 
                 -> Manipulates the converted csv files
                 ->Prepares the Request For Quotes(RFQs) excel files easily readible and comprehensive to vendors
